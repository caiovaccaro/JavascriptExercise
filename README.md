# JavascriptExercise

This is a growing exercise, it will get more shape and steps as the current ones get completed.

### Previous steps:

- [Step 1](https://github.com/caiovaccaro/JavascriptExercise/)

### Step 2

Modify your application in a way that:

- Loads the menu and the first page data in a Promise and only render the index page after it has been resolved
- Use a filter high-order function in order to just display enabled menu items
- When a user clicks a link, the corresponding view appear
- When a user clicks a link, this link (and only this link) should be active (visual distinction)
- The corresponding view should use the correspondent data.json file


#### Dependencies
- [Q](http://documentup.com/kriskowal/q/)
- [Lo-dash](https://lodash.com/)

##### You can structure your application in one of the following ways:

- No frameworks, but Object Literal modules
- No frameworks, but AMD modules using RequireJS
- No frameworks, but CommonJS modules using Webpack
- No frameworks, but ES6 modules using SystemJS
- BackboneJS (with one of the modular concepts above)
- React (with one of the modular concepts above)
- KnockoutJS(with one of the modular concepts above)
- AngularJS (with one of the modular concepts above)
