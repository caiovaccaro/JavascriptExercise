# JavascriptExercise

This is a growing exercise, it will get more shape and steps as the current ones get completed.

Create an application that:

- Loads data from a .json file
- Build a menu accordingly (4 levels deep)
- When a user clicks a link, the corresponding view appear
- When a user clicks a link, this link (and only this link) should be active (visual distinction)
- The corresponding view consists only of a page title and two buttons (previous and next)
- The previous and next button should navigate to the next and previous menu link available
- If there are no previous or next links the corresponding button should not appear

You can structure your application in one of the following ways:

- No frameworks, but Object Literal modules
- No frameworks, but AMD modules using RequireJS
- No frameworks, but CommonJS modules using Webpack
- No frameworks, but ES6 modules using SystemJS
- BackboneJS (with one of the modular concepts above)
- React (with one of the modular concepts above)
- KnockoutJS(with one of the modular concepts above)
- AngularJS (with one of the modular concepts above)
- EmberJS (with one of the modular concepts above)

Bonus: Try to use the Mediator Pattern
